# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal is to continually enhance my knowledge and practical skills in various programming languages and concepts. The Physics Simulator is a project I developed to deepen my understanding of the Java language, specifically in the context of game physics and graphics. 

The Physics Simulator is a Java-based application that demonstrates the principles of Newtonian physics in a 2D environment. The software integrates a physics engine for realistic object interaction, a user interface for real-time control and coordination, and a graphical representation of the physical phenomena.

I developed this software to gain a practical understanding of Java's object-oriented capabilities, its graphics libraries, and to learn how to model real-world phenomena like physics in a digital environment.

# Development Environment

The software was developed using the Visual Studio Code IDE. Java was the main language used for the entire development. I utilized the javax.swing and java.awt libraries for creating the user interface and the graphics, respectively. 

# Useful Websites

Below are some of the websites that I found immensely useful during this project:

- [Oracle Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)

# Future Work

There are several areas in the project that could be improved or expanded upon:

- Enhance the physics model to account for more complex phenomena such as friction and air resistance.
- Implement more interactive features, allowing users to manipulate objects in real-time.
- Improve the visualization by adding color, shading, and possibly 3D effects.
